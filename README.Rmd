The goal of quickNmix is to aid in the fitting of asymptotic N-mixture models, which are computed significantly faster than their canonical counterpart when population sizes are large.

## Installation

You can install the released version of quickNmix from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quickNmix")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrparker909/quickNmix")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
