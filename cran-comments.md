## Resubmission
This is a resubmission, based on feedback from Uwe Ligges. In this version I have:

* Extended the DESCRIPTION description to include a reference to a N-mixture models manuscript, and a reference to the asymptotic paper, which is currently in preparation (there is no hyperlink available for this reference at this time).
* Changed the version number to a more reasonable value: version 1.0.2.
* Updated the package date to 2021-06-20
  
## Test environments
* local: Windows 10 install, R 4.1.0
* rhub: Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC
* rhub: Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran

## R CMD check results
There is one NOTE to ignore, as these are correctly spelled surnames:  
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:  
  Cao (27:336)  
  Cowen (27:321)  
  Dail (27:102)  
  Madsen (27:111)  
  
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or other NOTEs.
