## Resubmission
This is a resubmission, based on feedback from Gregor Seyer. In this version I have:

* added an example/test for the exported function fitNmix
* added an example/test for the exported function nll
  
## Test environments
* local: Windows 10 install, R 4.1.0
* rhub: Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC
* rhub: Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran

## R CMD check results
There is one NOTE to ignore, as these are correctly spelled surnames:
