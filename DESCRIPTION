Description: For fitting asymptotic N-mixture models. Asymptotic N-mixture models extend the work of Dail and Madsen (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01465.x>, to consider asymptotic solutions to the open population N-mixture models. The asymptotic models are derived and described in: "Parker, M.R.P., Elliott, L., Cowen, L.L.E., Cao, J. (2021). Asymptotic solutions for N-mixture models with count data [Manuscript in preparation]. Department of Statistics and Actuarial Sciences, Simon Fraser University.".
